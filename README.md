# Cherry-Picker Helper

An Application to help cherry-pick when the base branch is modified, in my point of view, merge might be useful, but it prone to error while modification of same files happens, using rebase is safer.
Sometimes, using rebase, we couldn't having a checkpoint, when we abort, it will abort entirely. So, I prefer using cherry-pick (by renaming working branch to something else first)
